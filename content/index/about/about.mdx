import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I studied a Bachelors of Mathematics and Commerce at The University of Queensland with a 
focus on Statistics, Operations Research and Finance. 

I'm currently working as a Data & AI Consultant at Deloitte (previously at EY) where I
design and implement cloud and on-prem solutions involving:
- Statistical/Simulation Modelling and Machine Learning
- End-to-end Data Engineering pipelines 
- Business Intelligence (analytics and reporting)
- Intelligent Automation 

In my off time I can be found at the gym, going bouldering or for a run.
